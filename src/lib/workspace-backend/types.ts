/**
 * The contract between the workspace screens and whatever stores their data.
 *
 * Every persisted thing in the workspace (companies, contacts, settings, the map, the invoice…) is a named
 * resource. A screen never touches storage or the network: it asks the store for a resource, and the store
 * talks to a `WorkspaceBackend`. The default backend keeps everything in this browser; `createHttpBackend`
 * speaks a documented REST convention (docs/backend-api.md) and any other transport can implement the same
 * interface.
